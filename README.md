# belly-button-challenge
This is my repository for the Module 14 Challenge Assignment of the Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp.
The prompt for this assignment is as follows:
"In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare."
